For Windows users, get the Doxygen program from http://www.doxygen.org
or http://sourceforge.net/projects/doxygen and install it. If you want nice class
diagrams you must also install Graphviz (http://graphviz.org).

For Debian GNU/Linux users, there are apptitude packages for both.

apt-get install doxygen
apt-get install doxygen-doc
apt-get install doxygen-gui
apt-get install graphviz
apt-get install graphviz-doc
