This program implements a simple 3 oscillator FM synthesis instrument.

The four buttons on the right select the "algorithm." In the single modulator stack only Modulator I affects the carrier. In the double stack configuration, Modulator II is applied to Modulator I and then Modulator I is applied to the carrier. In the "Y" configuration, the modulators are summed and the sum applied to the carrier. Algorithm 4 is a combination of the stack and "Y" algorithms.

Carrier frequency is specified as a pitch number (0-120) with middle C at index 60 (ala MIDI). Modulator frequency is specified as a multiple of the carrier in the range 0-10 and may be harmonic (integer values) or inharmonic (real values).

The envelope generators are simple AR types with attack and decay rates in the range 0-1 second. The "sustain" time is the total duration minus the attack and decay times.

The amplitude of the carrier EG sets the volume level. The amplitude of a modulator sets the modulation depth and is specified as an index of modulation, per Chowning's method. The index of modulation has a range of 0-50.

Values can be entered using the sliders or by typing directly into the edit fields. Moving out of an edit field automatically updates the slider position.

Sound can be played from this program. The "Play" button (>) plays the sound once. The "Loop" button plays the sound repeatedly.

The sound can be saved as a single channel (monophonic) .WAV file.
