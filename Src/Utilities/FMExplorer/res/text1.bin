This program implements a simple 3 oscillator FM synthesis instrument.

The four Algorithm buttons select the connection between oscillators. In the single modulator stack only Modulator I affects the carrier. In the double stack configuration, Modulator II is applied to Modulator I and then Modulator I is applied to the carrier. In the "Y" configuration, the modulators are summed and the sum applied to the carrier. Algorithm 4 is a combination of the stack and "Y" algorithms.

Carrier frequency is specified as a pitch number (0-120) with middle C at index 60. Modulator frequency is specified as a multiple of the carrier in the range 0-10 and may be harmonic (integer values) or inharmonic (real values).

The envelope generators are ADSR types with attack, decay, and sustain times specified in seconds.

The amplitude of the carrier envelope sets the volume level. The amplitude of a modulator sets the modulation depth and is specified as an index of modulation. The index of modulation has a range of 0-50.

Values can be entered using the sliders or by typing directly into the edit fields. Moving out of an edit field automatically updates the slider position.

The buttons at the bottom of the display provide some example settings.

Sound can be played from this program. The "Play" button (>) plays the sound once. The "Loop" button plays the sound repeatedly until the "Stop" button is pressed.

The sound can be saved as a single channel (monophonic) .WAV file by pressing the "speaker" button. The settings can be copied to the clipboard using the "paste" button.
