<h1>Project Properties</h1>
<p>The Project Properties form is used to set the general properties for the project
along with synthesizer settings.</p>
<img src="images/projectproperties.jpg" alt="Project Properties" />
<p>
The <b>Name</b> field sets the project name. The name is only displayed in the project tree for reference and does not have to match
the project file name. The <b>Composer</b>, <b>Copyright</b> and <b>Description</b> are stored in the project file. 
These fields are useful for keeping program notes, date of composition, and similar information about the composition.
You can enter information here, or leave the values blank if you wish. However, since muscial works are protected by copyright so long
as a notice is provided, it is a good idea to always put a copyright notice in the project file.
</p>
<p>
The <b>Project File</b> field shows the complete path to the project file. Although you can change this information, it is
better to use the Save Project As menu entry. The project directory should be changed with care. Several files, including score files,
are assumed to be located in the same directory as the project file. Changing the project file directory may result in files failing to open.
</p>
<p>
The <b>Output File</b> field contains the file name for the wave file produced by the generate function. If this file is not located in the
project directory, you can enter a full path to the file. Otherwise, only the file name is required since by default the file will be written
into the project directory.
</p>
<p>The <b>Sample Rate</b> and <b>Format</b> fields control the format of the output file. If you plan on creating a CD from
the wave file, use a sample rate of 44100 and 16-bit PCM format. Higher sampling rates, and the 32-bit float format should be used
if you plan on processing the output file with an audio file editor. Lower sampling rates are sometimes necessary if you want to 
play the sound directly to the computer sound card. Slower processors may not be able to generate the sound in real time at higher
sampling rates.</p>
<p>
The <b>Leader</b> and <b>Tail</b> fields indicate how many seconds of slience should be added at the beginning or end of
a wave file. The tail value is also necessary if you are using reverb or echo effects. The output generator will continue to read
the mixer during the tail time, allowing the reverb to fade away naturally.
</p>
<p>
The <b>WT Size</b> field controls the wavetable length. Longer wavetables require more memory, but provide higher quality waveforms.
On older software synthesizers wavetables were kept small (&lt; 1k) in order
to preserve memory. Personal computers today generally have more than enough memory to allow for larger wavetables.
Wavetables 16k in length are a good compromise between memory use and audio quality.
For the <i>BasicSynth</i> instrument set, wavetables should not exceed 16K in length. Some of the instruments use a fast
fixed-point oscillator for LFO and that oscillator cannot use longer wavetables. If you are only using the ModSynth instrument, you can
increase the wavetable size to any value you feel is appropriate. In any case, wavetable length should be a power of 2.
</p>
<p>The <b>User WT</b> shows the number of user-defined wavetables. This value can only be set in the properties form
a new project, and is only used to pre-allocate wavetables. You can always add new wavetables by right-click on the Synthesizer
item in the project tree.</p>
<p>The <b>File Folders</b> list contains a list of directories, other than the project file directory, that contain score and instrument
libraries used by the project. This list is usefull if you create collections of scores and instruments that you want to use in multiple
compositions. If a file is not found in the project directory, the program will search this list of directories to find the file. To add
a new directory, click on the <b>+</b> button and select the directory. To remove a directory, select an item in the list and press the 
<b>X</b> button. The up and down arrow buttons are used to change the order in which directories are searched.</p>
<p>The <b>Wave Files</b> field is used to enter the location for wave files used by the WFSynth instrument. The project
options values contain a default directory for wave files. This field can override the default setting for this project and
only needs to be filled in if you are using files in a different location than that specified in the default project options.</p>
<h2>Project Options</h2>
<p>The project options form sets defaults that apply to all <i>BasicSynth</i> projects.</p>
<img src="images/projectoptions.jpg" alt="Project Options" />
<p>The <b>Composer</b> and <b>Copyright</b> fields contain values that will be copied to a new project</p>
<p>The <b>Project Tree Options</b> control whether or not additional file types are listed in the project tree.
To enable a file format, click the appropriate button on the form.  These options are applied when a project
is opened. To apply changes, you must reopen the project.</p>
<p><i>BasicSynth</i> supports two different score files, Notelist and Sequence. Notelist files provide an intuitive
score format and are the default score file type. Sequence files contain a simplified score format consisting
only of numbers for each sequencer event object. The format is similar to that of the Music <i>N</i> software
systems. It is intended for import from other software synthesis systems, or as output from composition programs.
A description of this format is contained in the <i>BasicSynth</i> book for those who have need of it.</p>
<p>The <b>Script Files</b> option creates a node in the project tree for JavaScript and other script files. Currently,
the script engines are not supported in <i>BasicSynth</i>. Future versions will include this feature. However, this
type is also useful for program files that are associated with the project.</p>
<p>The <b>Text Files</b> option adds a node in the project tree for generic text files. These files can be used
to associate various information with a project. For example, if you want to create a file of program notes, sketches,
or other such information and be able to edit the files from within <i>BasicSynth</i>, you can enable this option
so that you have direct access to the files.</p>
<p>The <b>Libraries</b> option adds a node in the project tree for instrument libraries. If you are not using
any libraries, you can disable this function to remove unnecessary information in the project tree view.</p>
<p>The <b>Project Files</b> field contains the path to the default directory for projects. <i>BasicSynth</i>
will set this directory as the current directory when it starts. However, you can still create projects in any directory you choose. In addition,
The Windows shell keeps track of the last used directory and will typically open file dialogs in the last location
you used from <i>BasicSynth</i>, regardless of the current directory.</p>
<p>The <b>Wave-In</b> directory specifies the path to wave files for the WFSynth instrument. You can override this
value for a project using the project properties</p>
<p>The <b>Forms</b> directory specifies the path to the instrument editor form layout and color files. All instruments
use a configurable definition of the instrument editor to allow customization of the instrument editor. It is possible to
create custom forms for the editors and then change the forms directory option to point to the custom forms.</p>
<p>The <b>Colors</b> field contains the name of the file that controls the color scheme used in instrument, mixer, and keyboard
forms. Several colors files are included by default. If you want to use a different color scheme, change the name in this field
to one of the Colors*.xml files found in the forms directory. You can also create your own color schemes by copying
one of the colors files and entering new values. Each color is defined by a hexadecimal value. The value can be
four or eight digits. In the eight digit form, the upper two digits contain the alpha value, followed by two digits each
for red, green and blue. The four digit form uses one digit for alpha, red, green and blue. 
The names of the colors should be self-explanatory. </p>
<p>(A future version of this document will describe the colors and forms files in detail. 
For now, if you want to customize something, you will have to experiment, or study the source code, to figure them out.
If you edit the forms, you can freely change the positions and colors, but make sure to adjust the size of
groups to reflect the size of contained widgets. Hint: the 'lo' and 'hi' colors control the limits of gradient fill patterns.
Do not change the ID or IP attributes, and be careful if you change the type
of the widget to only use a compatible type. I.E., pushswitch, imageswitch and lamp types are interchangable. 
Dial, knob, baseknob and slider are interchangeable as well. Some fields can be removed safely, mostly labels,
but many value inputs and graph objects are coded into the program and must be in the form and of the 
proper type or "bad things" will happen.) </p>
<p>The <b>Libraries</b> field contains the default path for instrument libraries. (This is not really necessary since
the project file can contain the appropriate entries in the Files Path.)</p>
<p>The <b>Play Latency</b> controls buffering for live playback of a score. The value represents the time
for one playback buffer. Five buffers are used, thus the maximum latency is five times the specified value.
Shorter values cause playback to be closer to score processing time, but may "hiccup" if there
is insufficient time to generate the next sample buffer. Longer buffer times provide more processing lead time,
but cause a delay between the score time and the actual time samples are heard. (Watch the "time" display
during playback to see the effect of the latency value. With the default setting of 0.5 seconds, the displayed time 
can be up to two seconds ahead of what you hear. Change the latency value to 0.05 seconds and the displayed
time is almost the same as what you hear.) Note: the latency value only applies to score playback. The keyboard
uses a fixed rate of 20ms and four buffers to keep latency to a minimum for interactive playing of the
keyboard.</p>
