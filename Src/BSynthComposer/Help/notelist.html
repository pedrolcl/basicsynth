<h1>Notelist<hr/></h1>
<p>A Notelist score contains one or more <i>voices</i> and <i>sequences</i>,
each containing a combination of <i>control statements</i> and <i>note
statements</i>. A voice is used to group one or more notes that follow
sequentially in time. A sequence defines a set of statements than can be
inserted into a voice by &ldquo;playing&rdquo; the sequence. A control statement either
changes the settings associated with a voice or controls how Notelist
interprets the score. Note statements define sounds to be played by the synthesizer.</p>

<p>Collecting notes into voices allows us to define notes without having to
calculate the starting time for each note individually. As each note is
generated, the start time is automatically moved forward by the duration of the
note. In addition, each voice maintains current volume level, tempo,
articulation, transposition, and default parameter values for notes. This
allows each note to be specified with a minimal amount of information.</p>

<p>Most control statements only affect the current voice, but a few are global
and may occur outside of a voice. Global control statements must be used
carefully since they affect all subsequent notes in all voices. </p>

<h2><a name="nlpitch">Pitch</a><hr/></h2>

<p>Each note statement begins with a value for the pitch. The pitch can be an
integer value with middle C represented by the value of 48. Pitch can also be
represented by a letter representing pitch class, followed by an optional
accidental and octave. The pitch letter is one of A-G. The accidental can be
&lsquo;#&rsquo; for sharp, &lsquo;b&rsquo; for flat, &lsquo;x&rsquo; for double sharp and &lsquo;d&rsquo; for double flat. The
octave value 4 represents the octave of middle C. For example, &lsquo;C4&rsquo; is middle
C, and &lsquo;F#3&rsquo; is F# below middle C. Octave numbers carry forward for successive
pitches and only need to be entered when the octave changes. Accidentals, however,
must be specified whenever they occur since there is no concept of &lsquo;key&rsquo; in
Notelist.</p>

<p>Rests are indicated by a pitch letter of &lsquo;R&rsquo;.</p>

<h2><a name="nlrhythm">Rhythm</a><hr/></h2>

<p>Rhythm can be represented as absolute time in seconds or by a rhythm value.
A rhythm value represents a fraction of a whole-note at the current tempo and
is indicated by a &lsquo;%&rsquo; followed by a number. For example, &lsquo;%4&rsquo; is a quarter-note
and &lsquo;%8&rsquo; is an eighth-note. The number in a rhythm value is not required to
be a standard sub-division of the beat. Thus, %10 would be 1/10 of a whole
note, and %2.5 would represent 4/10 of a whole-note. </p>

<p>Because a rhythm value is relative to the duration of a whole note, the
actual duration will vary depending on the current tempo. Absolute time
values are used when the exact time of the note is important, but, in general, it
is better to use rhythm values so that durations can be changed globally using
a tempo change rather than having to retype the duration for each note.</p>

<h2><a name="nldynamic">Dynamics</a><hr/></h2>

<p>Dynamics (i.e., volume levels) are specified with a number in the range 0 to
100. A value of 0 represents silence and 100 represents maximum amplitude
available in the synthesizer. Dynamics can be controlled on a note-by-note
basis. In addition, a <i>volume </i>statement can be used to modify the
per-note volume levels for all subsequent notes in a voice. Volume levels are
linear amplitude values, not decibels.</p>

<h2><a name="nlparams">Synthesizer Parameters</a><hr/></h2>

<p>In addition to pitch, rhythm and dynamics, a note statement can include any
number of values that represent synthesizer parameters. Instrument parameters are
passed to the synthesizer and are not interpreted by Notelist. The number of
parameters and their interpretation is dependent on the synthesizer instrument.</p>

<h2><a name="nlexpr">Notelist Expressions</a><hr/></h2>

<p>In most cases where a value is allowed, the value can be either a single
number or a calculated value. A calculated value is called an <i>expression</i>.
An expression consists of operands separated by operators. The operand in an
expression can be a number, character string, pitch, rhythm or variable.
Operators can be one of the following.</p>

<p>Operator precedence is from top to bottom of the table. For example,
multiplication, division and exponentiation have higher precedence than
addition and subtraction and are evaluated first. Equal precedence operators
are evaluated in order, left to right. Parts of the expression can be grouped
within parentheses to override the order of evaluation. For example, 5*4+2
would multiply first then add, but 5*(4+2) would add first then multiply. </p>

<p>Internally, pitch values are converted into the equivalent integer value and
may be used as number values in an expression. For example, C4+1 represents a
semi-tone above middle C and is the same as C#4. C4+12 would be one octave
higher, i.e., C5. Pitch values cannot be treated in the same manner as
frequency. For example, C4*2 is not one octave higher than C4. It would be
equivalent to 48*2=96, which is pitch C8.</p>

<p>Rhythm values can also appear as operands in an expression, making
specification of tied and dotted rhythms easier. For example, %4+%8 is
equivalent to a quarter note tied to an eighth note, while %4*3+%8 is equal to
three quarter notes and an eighth note tied together.</p>

<p>Operands may also be one of the built-in variables:</p>

<tr><td>curpit</td><td>Last pitch value</td></tr>
<tr><td>curdur</td><td> Last duration value</td></tr>

<h2><a name="nlexamples">Examples</a><hr/></h2>

<p>Some examples of Notelist script syntax are
shown below. In the following examples keywords are shown in lower case
letters. However, Notelist does not distinguish between upper and lower case
for keywords, (i.e., <i>VOICE</i>, <i>Voice</i>, and <i>voice</i> are all
equivalent).</p>
<p>Notelist is designed to be as intuitive as possible for musicians while still allowing 
extensions useful for synthesizers. Notelist is modeled on traditional musical notation
but using text encoding instead of a graphical representation. For example, we can take
a traditional music score like the following:</p>
<img src="images/nlexample1.jpg" alt="example1" />
<p>and write it in Notelist as follows: </p>
<pre>tempo 4, 60;<br/>
voice 1
begin
  instrument &ldquo;melody&rdquo;;
  volume 100;
  channel 0;
  C4, %4, 100;
  D4, %4, 100;
  E4, %4, 100;
  F4, %4, 100;
  G4, %4, 100;
  B3, %4, 100;
  C4, %2, 100;
end

voice 2
begin
  instrument &ldquo;bass&rdquo;;
  volume 95;
  channel 1;
  C3, %2, 100, 10, 20;
  A2, %2, 100, 10, 30;
  G2, %2, 100, 15, 20;
  C3, %2, 100, 10, 20;
end
</pre>

<p>This example contains two voices that play simultaneously. Each voice is
identified with an integer value. The lines between the <i>begin...end </i>keywords
specify the sequence of notes played on the voice. Each note statement consists
of a pitch, rhythm, volume level and optional parameters. The first voice plays
notes from C4 to G4, B3, C4 in quarter notes using an instrument named "melody" on mixer
channel 0. The second voice plays C3, A2, G2, C3 in half notes on an instrument named "bass"
on mixer channel 1 at a slightly lower volume level.
</p>
<p>
The <i>tempo</i> statement is optional and only needed when the rhythm is
indicated with the &lsquo;%&rsquo; form. In this case, the tempo is set to quarter notes at
60 bpm. Notice that the tempo statement is outside the first voice indicating
it is a global control statement. This statement, and a few others, apply to
all voices regardless of where the statement is located and are applied from
the point where they are located in the file. A tempo statement within a voice
will modify all notes in subsequent voices, not only notes within the voice. </p>
<p>
The lines beginning with <i>instrument</i> define which instrument should be
used to play the following notes. An instrument statement is an example of a
Notelist control statement. Control statements affect the performance of
subsequent notes in the voice but do not produce any sound output. 
Only note statements generate sound.
</p>
<p>Each note or control statement must be terminated with a semi-colon. Because
a note is terminated with a semi-colon, a note can contain a variable number of
parameters and can span multiple lines, and multiple notes can be placed on a
single line. Blank lines can be inserted at any point to help set-off different
phrases, sections, etc. Likewise, a comma is used to separate items in a list.
Spaces, tabs, and end of lines (whitespace) are generally ignored by the
Notelist program and can be used freely to format the score in any manner
desired. Spaces are required to separate a keyword (such as voice) from
subsequent values, but otherwise spaces can be included or left out as desired.
</p>

<p>The <i>begin...end</i> keywords are used to enclose multiple note statements.
Without them each note must begin with a <i>voice</i> keyword. For example, we could
have written the previous example like this:</p>

<pre>
tempo 4, 60;

voice 1 instrument &ldquo;melody&rdquo;;
voice 1 channel 0;
voice 1 volume 100;
voice 2 instrument &ldquo;bass&rdquo;;
voice 2 channel 1;
voice 2 volume 95;

voice 1 C4, %4, 100;
voice 1 D4, %4, 100;
voice 2 C3, %2, 100;

voice 1 E4, %4, 100;
voice 1 F4, %4, 100;
voice 2 A2, %2, 100;

voice 1 G4, %4, 100;
voice 1 B3, %4, 100;
voice 2 G2, %2, 100;

voice 1 C4, %2, 100;
voice 2 C3, %2, 100;
</pre>

<p>Because each voice maintains separate values for the current time and
instrument, notes in a voice do not need to be contiguous. A Notelist score can
freely switch between voices, or can group all notes of each voice together
with <i>begin...end</i>. A voice can also be entered using multiple <i>begin...end</i>
blocks because the starting time for each block begins at the end time of the
previous block.</p>

<p>A note is defined by a pitch, rhythm and volume value, but only the pitch
needs to be explicit if the rhythm and volume values are the same as the
previous note. For example, the first voice above could be written as:</p>

<pre>
voice 1
begin
  C4, %4, 100;
  D4; E4; F4; G4; B3;
  C4, %2;
end
</pre>

<p>Typically, pitch and rhythm are specified for each note for clarity. The
shortened form is most useful when a note statement contains a group of notes.
A group is indicated by enclosing values in braces with each value separated by
a comma. This notation not only allows multiple notes to be easily contained on
one line and avoids entering duplicate values, but is also an intuitive way to
represent a musical phrase. For example:</p>

<pre>
voice 1
begin
  { C4, D4, E4, F4, G4, B3 }, %4, 100;
  C4, %2, 100;
end
</pre>

<p>As with the previous example, only one rhythm value and one volume value are
specified and thus repeat for subsequent notes. We can provide a group for rhythm
and volume values as well and allow the pitch value to repeat. In the following
example, the pitch C4 is repeated four times followed by C4 through F4. The
volume value is not specified on the second note statement since it will carry
forward from the previous note.</p>

<pre>
voice 1
begin
  C4, { %4, %16, %16, %2 }, 100;
  { C4, D4, E4, F4}, { %4, %16, %16, %2 };
end
</pre>

<p>When using multiple groups on a single line, the longest group controls the
number of notes that are played. In the following example, the first note
statement plays C4 and D4 as quarter notes followed by E4 and F4 both as half
notes. The second statement plays C4 four times with a crescendo.</p>

<pre>
voice 1
begin
  { C4, D4, E4, F4 }, { %4, %4, %2 }, 100;
  C4, %4, { 50, 60, 75, 100 };
end
</pre>

<p>A pitch group can also be enclosed in square brackets to represent
simultaneous pitches, (i.e., a chord). If only one rhythm value is given, it
will apply to all pitches in the chord. However, it is possible to specify
different rhythm values for each pitch. In any case, the start time of the note
following the chord will be determined by the longest duration in the chord. In
the following example, the first note statement plays a C-Major chord for one
quarter note, followed by a F-Major chord for one quarter note, but with only
the C4 pitch sounding through the entire duration.</p>

<pre>
voice 1
begin
  [ C4, E4, G4 ], %4, 30;
  [ C4, F4, A4 ], { %4, %8, %8 }, 30;
  C5, %4, 30;
end
</pre>

<p>The volume level has been lowered to 30 since we have three notes sounding simultaneously. This is an
important consideration when notes either sound simultaneously or overlap due to a long decay.</p>

<p>A note group can be preceded by the keywords <i>sus</i> (sustain) or <i>tie</i>
in order to modify the interpretation of the duration values. The <i>sus</i>
keyword causes the first note in a group to be interpreted as the total
duration for all notes in the group. Subsequent note start times are
interpreted as a delay from the previous note. This produces the effect of a
roll or arpeggio with earlier notes held through the total duration.</p>

<pre>sus { C4, E4, G4, C5 }, { %1, %8, %8, %8 }, 25;</pre>

<p>In this statement the total duration is a whole note with each successive
pitch played an eight-note apart. A value of 0 for a duration after the first
will cause a pitch to sound simultaneously with the previous pitch.</p>

<pre>sus { C4, E4, G4, C5 }, { %1, 0, %8, %8 }, 25;</pre>

<p>In this case, C4 and E4 sound together followed by G4 and C5 spaced an
eighth note apart.</p>

<p>The <i>tie</i> keyword causes the first value in the group to be interpreted
as the starting value with subsequent values representing modifications to the
note. As with <i>sus</i> the rhythm values specify a delay from the previous
value.</p>

<pre>tie { C4, E4, G4, C4 }, { %1, %4, %4, %4 }, 100;</pre>

<p>In synthesizer terms, a tie alters the oscillator frequency, volume level,
and other parameters without resetting the oscillator phase or re-triggering
the envelope generator. Not all synthesis instruments have this capability, and
changing parameters that alter the envelope may have no effect on a sounding
note.</p>
<h2>Algorithmic Composition with Notelist<hr/></h2>
<p>The previous examples are similar to traditional notation. However, Notelist also includes a variety
of programming features that allow generation of notes by calculation. The following
example defines sequences for major and diminished arpeggios and then
plays the arpeggios on different pitches.</p>
<pre>
var arppit;

seq "arpmaj"
begin
	arppit, %16, 100;
	arppit+4, %16, 100;
	arppit+7, %16, 100;
	arppit+12, %16, 100;
end

seq "arpdim"
begin
	arppit, %16, 100;
	arppit+3, %16, 100;
	arppit+6, %16, 100;
	arppit+9, %16, 100;
end

voice 1
begin
	instr "Synth1";
	chnl 0;
	volume 100;

	set arppit = C3;
	loop 4 play "arpmaj";
	set arppit = F3;
	loop 4 play "arpmaj";
	set arppit = B2;
	loop 4 play "arpdim";
	set arppit = C3;
	loop 4 play "arpmaj";
	C3, %4, 100;
end
</pre>
<p>In the next example, Notelist statements produce a random series of pitches centered around middle C with the rhythm
values increasing from an eighth note to a sixteenth note triplet followed by a series of notes that fade away
as the pitch rises chromatically.</p>
<pre>
voice 1
begin
  instrument "Synth1";
  channel 0;
  volume 100;
  init 0 exp %8, %24, 40;
  loop 40 C4+rand(-5,5), fgen(0,1), 100;
  init 0 line 100, 20, 24;
  loop 24 C4+count, %24, fgen(0,1);
end
</pre>
<p>Because a Notelist score is a text file, it is possible to edit the score with any text editor and
also possible to generate a score programatically. Since any program that can produce
a text file can produce a Notelist score, Notelist can also be used as the output format 
for automated composition programs.</p>
<hr />
<h1><a name="nlref">Notelist Reference</a><hr/></h1>

<p>An alphabetized list of valid Notelist statements follows. Keywords may be
any mixture of upper and lower case. Arguments are indicated in <i>italics </i>while
keywords are indicated by capitalized text.</p>

<h3><a name="artic">ARTIC</a></h3>

<p>Syntax: artic <i>type value</i>;</p>

<p>The ARTIC statement modifies the actual duration of notes. The start time of
a note is always controlled by the rhythm value of the previous note and ARTIC does not
alter the relative start times, only the sounding duration. This allows the
duration of notes to be specified independently of the time interval between
notes. Notes can thus be spaced or overlapped as needed while still using
rhythm values to control the timing between note start times.</p>

<p>Articulation can be entered using an ARTIC control statement or by adding
the articulation value after the volume level. In either case, the articulation
value can be one of three types. A <i>fixed</i> articulation value sets the
duration of the note to the articulation value regardless of the rhythm value.
An <i>add</i> articulation value adds to the note duration. A <i>percent</i>
articulation value extends the note by a percentage of the rhythm value.</p>

<pre>
voice 1

  artic add 0.1;

end
</pre>

<p>The first ARTIC statement causes the subsequent note to be played for 1/10
second longer than the given duration causing an overlap with the following
note. The second ARTIC statement causes the note to be played for 90% of the
given duration, producing a short gap between notes similar to <i>staccato</i>.
The third ARTIC statement causes the notes to be played for the duration of a
whole note even though the duration of the following note is given as a quarter
note. The last ARTIC statement causes the note duration to be modified using
the values after the volume. The first note is held for 80% duration, the
second at 90% duration, and the third at 100% of the duration.</p>

<h3><a name="beginend">BEGIN...END</a></h3>

<p>Syntax: begin <i>notelist</i> end</p>

<p>BEGIN and END are used to bracket multiple statements. Although they can
occur anywhere within a voice, typically they are used to group statements
following a VOICE, SEQUENCE, LOOP, IF...ELSE, or WHILE...DO statement. </p>

<h3><a name="call">CALL</a></h3>

<p>Syntax: call &ldquo;<i>script</i>&rdquo;;</p>

<p>The CALL statement passes a string to an external script engine for
execution. Unlike the script statement, the CALL statement is executed during
sequence generation.</p>
<p>Note: This feature is not implemented in the current version of <i>BasicSynth</i>.</p>

<h3><a name="channel">CHANNEL</a></h3>

<p>Syntax: channel <i>number</i>;</p>

<p>The CHANNEL statement sets the mixer output channel for the current voice.
The single argument indicates the mixer channel number. </p>

<p>A voice is usually associated with a specific instrument and mixer input
channel. However, a voice can switch between instruments and channels at any
time, and multiple voices can be played on the same instrument or channel. This
is especially useful when complex polyphonic voices are used. For example, a
complex rhythm with overlapping notes can be specified more easily with
multiple voice lists.</p>

<pre>
voice 1
begin
  instrument &ldquo;piano&rdquo;;
  channel 0;
  {C4, D4, E4, F4}, {%4, %4, %8, %8}, 100;
end

voice 2
begin
  instrument &ldquo;piano&rdquo;;
  channel 0;
  {C3, G3, C3, G2}, {%16, %8, %16, %2}, 100;
end
</pre>

<p>The keyword CHANNEL can be abbreviated as CHNL. </p>

<h3><a name="comments">COMMENTS</a></h3>

<p>Syntax: ! <i>comment text</i></p>

<p>A comment is any text that should be ignored by the Notelist parser. A
comment begins with either an exclamation point (!) or a single quote (') and
extends to the end of the line.</p>

<pre>
! A bang comment
' A quoted text comment

voice 0   'comment after statement
begin
...
end
</pre>

<h3><a name="double">DOUBLE</a></h3>

<p>Syntax: double <i>transpose</i>,<i> volume</i>;</p>

<p>The DOUBLE keyword indicates that subsequent notes should be doubled at the
pitch offset given by <i>transpose</i> and the volume level indicated by <i>volume.
</i>The <i>volume </i>parameter is optional. Doubling is canceled by using the
keyword OFF for the transpose value.</p>

<pre>double 12, 50;<br/>{C4, D4, E4, F4, G4}, %4, 100;<br/>double OFF;<br/>{C4, D4, E4, F4, G4}, %4, 100;</pre>

<p>In this example, the first note statement would result in a scale played in
octaves with the upper note at a volume of 50 and the lower note at a volume of
100.</p>

<h3><a name="eval">EVAL</a></h3>

<p>Syntax: eval &ldquo;<i>string</i>&rdquo;</p>

<p>The EVAL keyword passes the string argument to an external scripting engine
for evaluation. EVAL is treated as a unary operator. If the argument is an expression
other than a string literal, it must be placed in parentheses.</p>

<p>Note: This feature is not yet implemented in Basic Synth.</p>

<h3><a name="fgen">FGEN</a></h3>

<p>Syntax: fgen(<i>unit</i>, <i>amount</i>)</p>

<p>The FGEN keyword invokes one of the built-in function generators. See INIT
for an explanation.</p>

<h3><a name="ifthenelse">IF...THEN...ELSE</a></h3>

<p>Syntax: if <i>condition </i>then <i>notelist </i>else <i>notelist</i></p>

<p>The IF...THEN...ELSE statement is used to conditionally execute statements. The <i>condition</i>
between IF and THEN is an expression that controls which statement is executed.
If the condition is true, the statement after THEN is executed. If the
condition is false, the statement after ELSE is executed. The ELSE part is
optional. The statement controlled by IF...THEN...ELSE can also be a BEGIN...END
block, allowing for a group of statements to be controlled by a single
condition.</p>

<p>In the following example IF is used to create two endings for a repeated
phrase.</p>

<pre>voice 1<br/>begin<br/>  loop (2)<br/>  begin<br/>    {C4, E4, G4, F4, A4}, %8, 100;<br/>    if count = 0 then<br/>      {C5, G4, E4}, %8, 100;<br/>    else<br/>      {B4, G4, C5}, %8, 100;<br/>  end<br/>end</pre>

<h3><a name="include">INCLUDE</a></h3>

<p>Syntax: include &ldquo;<i>filename</i>&rdquo;;</p>

<p>The INCLUDE statement includes another file into the current file. The <i>filename</i>
argument is normally a complete path to the file. Relative paths can be used and 
will be relative to the current directory where Notelist is running.</p>

<p>Note: In Basic Synth, the current directory is set to the project directory.</p>

<h3><a name="init">INIT</a></h3>

<p>Syntax: init <i>unit function start</i>,<i> end</i>,<i> step</i>;</p>

<p>Notelist includes a set of built-in functions that calculate a series of
values. The INIT statement is used to initialize the function generator. The <i>fgen</i>
operator is used to produce the next value in the series.</p>

<p>The <i>unit</i> argument is an integer value in the range [0,9] that
identifies the generator in later calls to <i>fgen</i>. Since function
generators can be reused, the <i>unit </i>range only limits the number of
generators that can be operating simultaneously within a voice.</p>

<p>The <i>start</i> argument indicates the starting value for the series. The <i>end</i>
argument indicates the ending value for the series. The <i>steps</i> argument
indicates how many discrete steps are calculated. The <i>type</i> argument
indicates one of the following:</p>

<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>LINE</td><td>The values will be linearly interpolated between start and end. </td></tr>
<tr><td>EXP</td><td>The values will be exponentially interpolated between start and end.</td></tr>
<tr><td>LOG </td><td>The values will be logarithmically interpolated between start and end.</td></tr>
<tr><td>RAND</td><td>The value will be a random value between start and end.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The <i>fgen</i> operator returns the current value of a function. The <i>unit
</i>value should match a previous init statement. The <i>fgen</i> function is
especially useful within loops to provide crescendo, decrescendo, or step-wise
alteration of the synthesizer parameters:</p>

<pre>init 0 line 50, 100, 10;<br/>loop 10<br/>  { C4, D, E, F, G}, 0.1, fgen(0,1);</pre>

<p>The <i>fgen</i> function is zero based. That is, on the first call it will
return the start value and will only return the end value after <i>n</i>+1
steps. Once <i>fgen</i> reaches the end of the series, the value will remain at
the end value until another <i>init</i> statement on the same unit is encountered, and
<i>fgen</i> will continue to return the end value when invoked. In the example
above, volume would range from 50 to 95. </p>

<p>When <i>fgen</i> is invoked, the second argument indicates how many steps to
move forward. The steps value in the init statement is usually an integer value
and <i>fgen</i> is invoked as <i>fgen</i>(<i>unit</i>,1) to retrieve the next
value. However, the steps value on the init statement can be set to a duration.
Each call to <i>fgen</i> should then indicate how much of that duration has
passed. This is useful to map a series of steps onto notes of varying duration.</p>

<pre>init 0 line 50, 100, %1;<br/>{ C4, D, E, F }, %4, fgen(0,%4);</pre>

<p>In addition to <i>fgen</i>, the <i>rand</i> function can be used to produce
a random value without first initializing a function with init. The two
arguments to <i>rand</i> are optional. Without arguments, <i>rand</i> returns a
value between 0 and 1.</p>

<h3><a name="instrument">INSTRUMENT</a></h3>

<p>Syntax: instrument <i>id</i>;</p>

<p>The INSTRUMENT statement identifies the synthesizer instrument for the current
voice. All notes subsequent to the INSTRUMENT statement will be played on the
indicated instrument. The <i>id </i>argument is typically a string that matches
a pre-defined synthesizer instrument, but can also be a number if appropriate. </p>

<p>Note: In Basic Synth, the id is always a string and must match one of the instruments
configured for the project. A number is used in versions of Notelist that export to other systems, e.g., CSound</p>

<h3><a name="loop">LOOP</a></h3>

<p>Syntax: loop (<i>count</i>) <i>notelist</i></p>

<p>The LOOP statement is used to repeat one or more note statements. The <i>count</i>
argument indicates the number of times the loop repeats. The <i>notelist</i> is
either a single note statement or a compound statement in the form of a
BEGIN...END block. The parentheses around the loop count are optional, but must
be included if the count expression could be interpreted as a part of the first
statement in the Notelist.</p>

<pre>loop 5<br/>  { C4, E, G, C5 }, 0.25, 50;<br/>&nbsp;<br/>loop 5<br/>begin<br/>  { C4, E, G, C5 }, 0.25, 50;<br/>  { C4, E, G, C5 }, 0.25, 80;<br/>  { C4, E, G, C5 }, 0.25, 100;<br/>end</pre>

<p>Loops can be nested within loops to any level:</p>

<pre>loop 5<br/>begin<br/>  { C4, E, G, C5 }, 0.25, 50;<br/>  { C4, E, G, C5 }, 0.25, 80;<br/>  loop 2<br/>  begin<br/>    { C4, E, G, C5 }, 0.25, 100;<br/>    loop 2<br/>      {C4, E, G, C5}, 0.125, 50;<br/>  end<br/>end</pre>

<p>Control statements apply to all notes from the point where they are
encountered and must be used carefully within loops. For example, a volume
statement at the end of a loop will apply to all iterations after the first. In
the following example, the first iteration will play at a volume level of 100
while iterations 2-5 will play at volume 50.</p>

<pre>volume 100;<br/>loop 5<br/>begin<br/>  { C4, E, G, C5 }, 0.25, 50;<br/>  volume 50;<br/>end</pre>

<p>However, this feature can be useful, especially with nested loops. In the
following example, the phrase is played four times, alternating between loud
and soft.</p>

<pre>loop 2<br/>begin<br/>  volume 100;<br/>  loop 2<br/>  begin<br/>     { C4, E, G, C5 }, 0.25, 50;<br/>   volume 50;<br/>  end<br/>end</pre>

<p>Loops are expanded by the Notelist parser, not the sequencer. Although this
produces a longer event sequence, it allows values within the loop to be
calculated during processing and thus different for each iteration. The COUNT
keyword can be used inside the loop to modify a value based on the number of
times the loop has played. The value is zero-based and varies from 0 to n-1,
where n is the loop count. The following loop uses the COUNT value to play a
chromatic scale with crescendo.</p>

<pre>loop (12) C4+count, %8, 40+(count*5);</pre>

<p>In the case of nested loops, each loop has its own instance of the COUNT<i> </i>value
and the value will always refer to the controlling loop count. In the following
example, the chromatic scale is played 5 times, each time at a higher volume
level.</p>

<pre>loop 5<br/>begin<br/>  volume 50+(count*10);<br/>  loop (12)<br/>    C4+count, %16, 80;<br/>end</pre>

<p>If COUNT is referenced outside of a loop it has a value of 0.</p>

<h3><a name="map">MAP</a></h3>

<p>Syntax: map <i>instrument </i> <i>params...</i>;</p>

<p>The MAP statement is used to translate a note parameter value. For
instruments with a small number of parameters, position dependent values is
generally not a problem. However, when the instrument includes a large number
of parameters it is often the case that we only want to give values for a small
number of the possible values. Parameter maps allow selecting a sub-set of an instrument&rsquo;s
parameters .</p>

<p>The values on the map statement specify the actual instrument parameter id
values for the <i>n</i><sup>th</sup> parameter on the note statement. Suppose
that an instrument uses parameter 18 to set the envelope attack and parameter
22 to set the envelope delay. Rather than list all 22 parameters on the note
statement, we can create a map of the two values we need. The following example
sets the first parameter to the attack rate and the second parameter to the
release rate.</p>

<pre>map &ldquo;iname&rdquo; 18, 22;<br/>voice 1<br/>begin<br/>  instr &ldquo;iname&rdquo;;<br/>  C4, %4, 100, 0.1, 0.4;<br/>end</pre>

<p>A parameter map can contain optional scaling values for each parameter. The
scaling value is specified by adding <i>:value</i> after the parameter id. This
allows parameters to be specified in a normalized range and also provides
automatic conversion of values when the instrument changes. For example,
suppose that two instruments both have a parameter to indicate a modulation of
the sound, but instrument <i>in1</i> has a range of 0-100 on  parameter 19
while <i>in2</i> has a range of 0-1 on parameter 20. We can create two maps so
that we can change between instruments without having to change the note
statement values.</p>

<pre>map &ldquo;in1&rdquo; 19;<br/>map &ldquo;in2&rdquo; 20:0.01;<br/>voice 1<br/>begin<br/>  instrument &ldquo;in1&rdquo;;<br/>  C4, %4, 100, 50;<br/>  instrument &ldquo;in2&rdquo;;<br/>  C4, %4, 100, 50;<br/>end</pre>

<p>These two statements play C4 on instrument 1 with a parameter value of 50
for parameter 19, and on instrument 2 with a parameter value of 0.5 for
parameter 20. If we later decide to switch the order of the instruments, the
note statements will still produce the correct parameter values.</p>

<p>Parameter numbers can also be given by a name in quotes, if the instrument supports name to ID mapping.</p>

<pre>map &ldquo;iname&rdquo; &ldquo;atk&rdquo;, &ldquo;dec&rdquo;;</pre>

<p>Instrument parameter maps are global and remain in effect until another map
statement is encountered for the instrument. However, maps can be changed
within a voice to allow varying the selection of parameters on subsequent
notes.</p>

<h3><a name="mark">MARK</a></h3>

<p>Syntax: mark <i>markid;</i></p>

<p>The MARK and SYNC statements are used to synchronize note start times
between voices. The argument to MARK and SYNC can be a string or number. The
MARK statement saves the current start time; the SYNC statement retrieves the
saved value and sets the voice start time.</p>

<pre>
voice 1
begin
  {C4, D4, E4, F4, G4}, {%12, %13, %14, %15, %16};
  mark &ldquo;cue1&rdquo;;
  {C4, D4, E4, F4}, %16, 100;
  G4, %4, 100;
end

voice 2
begin
  sync &ldquo;cue1&rdquo;;
  {C3, G3}, %4, 100;
end
</pre>

<p>In this example, the initial scale has duration values that make it
difficult to calculate the exact start point for voice 2. Using the MARK and
SYNC pair causes voice 2 to play the bass notes at the point where voice 1
reaches the 16th note scale. In addition, if the start time is moved, or the
rhythm of the first voice is changed prior to the mark point, the second voice
will still synchronize to the first voice.</p>

<h3><a name="maxparam">MAXPARAM</a></h3>

<p>Syntax: maxparam <i>number</i>;</p>

<p>The MAXPARAM statement redefines the maximum number of parameters allowed on
a note statement.</p>

<p>Each note statement carries forward the values from the previous note statement.
Since the number of parameters varies depending on the instrument, Notelist
cannot know in advance how many parameters should be retained. By default,
space for 10 values is allocated. If more or fewer parameters are needed,
MAXPARAM can be used to extend or reduce the size of the parameter buffer.</p>

<p>The value of MAXPARAM is global and applies to all instruments on all
voices.</p>

<h3><a name="middlec">MIDDLEC</a></h3>

<p>Syntax: middlec <i>number</i>;</p>

<p>The MIDDLEC statement is used to move the octave number of middle C. The
default value is 4 but sometimes it is useful to re-define this point. The
following statement would cause C6 to refer to middle C.</p>

<pre>middlec 6;</pre>

<p>The value of MIDDLEC is processed by the parser and must be a constant
integer, not an expression. Changing the octave of middle C only affects parsing and does not
change the integer value for middle C passed to the synthesizer.</p>

<h3><a name="midicc">MIDICC</a></h3>

<p>Syntax: midicc <i>control, value</i>;</p>

<p>The MIDICC statement emits a MIDI controller change message. 
The <i>control</i> argument specifies the MIDI controller number. 
The <i>value</i> argument is the value for the controller.
Both control and value must be in the ragne 0-127.</p>

<h3><a name="midipw">MIDIPW</a></h3>

<p>Syntax: midipw <i>value</i>;</p>

<p>The MIDIPW statement emits a MIDI pitch wheel change message. 
The <i>value</i> argument is the raw pitch bend value and should be in the range +/-8192.</p>

<h3><a name="midiprg">MIDIPRG</a></h3>

<p>Syntax: midiprg <i>value</i>;</p>

<p>The MIDIPRG statement emits a MIDI program change message. 
The <i>value</i> argument is the program number in the range 0-127.</p>

<h3><a name="midiat">MIDIAT</a></h3>

<p>Syntax: midiat <i>value</i>;</p>

<p>The MIDIAT statement emits a MIDI channel pressure (after touch) message. 
The <i>value</i> argument is the range 0-127.</p>

<h3><a name="mixer">MIXER</a></h3>

<p>Syntax: mixer <i>mixfn,  mixop, [fxunit], start, [end, time, [freq, wt]]</i>;</p>

<p>
The MIXER statement provides dynamic mixer control functions that set the value of an input level, pan or effects unit.
The <i>mixfn</i> argument can be one of the following:</p>
<table  border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>Argument</td><td>Use</td></tr>
<tr><td>in</td><td>Change an input level</td></tr>
<tr><td>pan</td><td>Change an input pan setting.</td></tr>
<tr><td>send</td><td>Change the amount sent to an effects unit.</td></tr>
<tr><td>fxin</td><td>Change an effects unit volume level.</td></tr>
<tr><td>fxpan</td><td>Change an effects unit pan setting.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>
A MIXER control statement that affects an input (in, pan or send) uses the current channel for the voice as the mixer channel number.
When the function is <i>fxin</i> or <i>fxpan</i>, the first argument indicates which effects unit is altered. 
The <i>mixop</i> argument is optional, and can be one of the following:</p>
<table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td>Argument</td><td>Use</td></tr>
<tr><td>set</td><td>Set the value to <i>start</i>. The other parameters are ignored. If the <i>mixop</i> argument is missing, set is assumed.</td></tr>
<tr><td>ramp</td><td>Produce a linear change from <i>start</i> to <i>end</i> over a duration of <i>time</i>.</td></tr>
<tr><td>osc</td><td>Continuously vary the value from <i>start</i> to <i>end</i> over a duration of <i>time</i> at the rate 
<i>freq</i> using the wavetable <i>wt</i>. If the wavetable argument is missing, a sine wave is used.</td></tr>
</table>

<h3><a name="note">NOTE</a></h3>

<p>Syntax: [note] <i>pitch</i>,<i> rhythm</i>,<i> volume</i>,<i> params</i>;</p>

<p>A NOTE statement defines a sound to be produced on the synthesizer. A
statement that does not begin with a keyword is considered a NOTE statement.
The NOTE keyword can also be used to indicate a note.</p>

<p>See the examples above for information on NOTE statements.</p>

<p>When the VELOCITY option is set, the note volume value is passed to the instrument as the note-on velocity.</p>

<h3><a name="option">OPTION</a></h3>

<p>Syntax: option <i>optname</i> {ON|OFF};</p>

<p>The OPTION statement sets one of three global options.</p>
<ol>
<li>frequency</li>
<li>voldb</li>
<li>velocity</li>
</ol>

<p>Normally the first parameter of a NOTE statement is interpreted as a pitch. Setting the FREQUECNY option
ON treats the value as the actual note frequency in Hz.</p>

<p>Normally volume values are normalized linear amplitude values. Setting the VOLDB option
ON treats the volume value as a decibel value. A value of 100 is mapped to 0dB (a linear
amplitude value of 1.0) while a value of 0 is mapped to -100dB (i.e. 100dB attenuation). </p>

<p>Normally the note volume is scaled and multiplied by the voice volume value. When the VELOCITY option
is ON, the note volume is passed to the instrument as the MIDI note-on velocity value and the voice value
is normalized (0-1) and passed as the volume level. When the VELOCITY option is OFF, the note-on velocity
is set to 127.</p>

<h3><a name="play">PLAY</a></h3>

<p>Syntax: play <i>sequence</i>;</p>

<p>The PLAY statement plays a defined sequence. </p>

<p>See <a href="#sequence">SEQUENCE.</a></p>

<h3><a name="param">PARAM</a></h3>

<p>Syntax: param <i>id</i>,<i> value</i>;</p>

<p>The PARAM statement sets a single instrument parameter. Parameter values on
a note statement are position dependent. Thus, to set parameter number <i>n</i> all
parameters up to <i>n</i> normally must appear on the note statement. The PARAM
statement allows changing a single parameter without specifying all other
parameters. The parameter <i>id</i> is zero-based (i.e., <i>id</i> 0 represents
the first parameter).</p>

<pre>
param 0, 1;
param 1, 2;
param 2, 3;
C4, 1, 100;
param 2, 4;
D4, 1, 100;
</pre>

<p>These statements are the equivalent of:</p>

<pre>
C4, 1, 100, 1, 2, 3;
D4, 1, 100, 1, 2, 4;
</pre>

<p>The second PARAM statement sets the third parameter to a value of 4 and
leaves other parameters at the previous value. </p>

<h3><a name="repeat">REPEAT</a></h3>

<p>Syntax: repeat (<i>count</i>)<i> notelist</i></p>

<p>REPEAT is an alternate keyword for LOOP. See <a href="#loop">LOOP.</a></p>

<h3><a name="script">SCRIPT</a></h3>

<p>Syntax: script <i>&ldquo;string&rdquo;;</i></p>

<p>The SCRIPT statement passes a character string to an external scripting
engine. The string argument to the script statement can be a file of scripting
language code that will be loaded into the scripting engine for later use, or
it can be a statement in the script language that is executed immediately. The
script statement is executed during parsing of the Notelist script.</p>

<h3><a name="set">SET</a></h3>

<p>Syntax: set <i>variable </i>= <i>value</i>;</p>

<p>The value of a variable is assigned using the SET statement. The SET
statement can appear within a voice as well as outside of a voice. The value on
the right of the &lsquo;=&rsquo; can be any valid expression and can include pitches and
rhythm values along with numbers. When a rhythm value is used, it is converted
to actual time at the point of the assignment.</p>

<pre>
set oct = 12;
set step = 1;
set val2 = C4 + (oct * step);
</pre>

<p>Any declared variable in Notelist can be treated as an associative array. When
the variable name is followed by an index in brackets, the index value is associated
with the value. The index can be a number or a string.</p>
<pre>
set myval["vol"] = 100;
set myval[0] = 200;
</pre>
<p>Arrays can be used to store a set of values that are iterated using
the <i>loop</i> or <i>while</i> statements. The following example
generates a random series of pitches and plays them 12 times,
transposing up a semitone each time.</p>

<pre>
var index;
var pits;

voice 0
begin

	set index = 0;
	while index &lt; 16 do
	begin
		set pits[index] = rand(48,60);
		set index = index + 1;
	end

	loop 12
	begin
		transpose count;
		loop 16
			pits[count], %16, 100;
	end
end
</pre>

<h3><a name="sequence">SEQUENCE</a></h3>

<p>Syntax: sequence <i>id </i>begin <i>notelist </i>end</p>

<p>A SEQUENCE statement begins definition of a note sequence. Often, it is
useful to define a series of notes that repeat at different places in the composition.
By defining the repeated phrase as a sequence, the notes can be inserted by
referring to the sequence rather than repeating entry of the notes. A sequence
is identified by a name or number and is invoked by that name or number from
within subsequent voice statements by using the PLAY statement.</p>

<p>The content of the sequence is enclosed in a BEGIN...END block and is the same
set of statements that can appear within a voice. The sequence itself must be
defined outside of any voice.</p>

<pre>sequence &ldquo;short&rdquo;<br/>begin<br/>  { C4, D, E, F}, {%4, %16, %16, %8}, 100;<br/>end<br/>&nbsp;<br/>voice 1<br/>begin<br/>  play &ldquo;short&rdquo;;<br/>  play &ldquo;short&rdquo;;<br/>end</pre>

<p>Since a sequence is played within the context of a voice, control statements
that modify the interpretation of subsequent notes should be used carefully.
For example, a TRANSPOSE statement within a sequence would remain in effect for
notes within the voice that come after the sequence is played.</p>

<p>The keyword SEQUENCE may be abbreviated to SEQ.</p>

<h3><a name="start">START</a></h3>
<p>Syntax: start <i>track, [loop]</i>;</p>
<p>The START statement starts a background track. The optional loop count indicates how many times the track should be played.
If the <i>loop</i> value is missing, or is zero, the track will play until a STOP statement is given.</p>

<h3><a name="start">STOP</a></h3>
<p>Syntax: stop <i>track</i>;</p>
<p>The STOP statement stops a background track.</p>

<h3><a name="sync">SYNC</a></h3>

<p>Syntax: sync <i>markid</i>;</p>

<p>See <a href="#mark">MARK.</a></p>

<h3><a name="system">SYSTEM</a></h3>

<p>Syntax: system &ldquo;<i>command</i>&rdquo;;</p>

<p>The SYSTEM statement invokes an external program using the system command
shell. SYSTEM is executed during parsing of the script.</p>

<h3><a name="tempo">TEMPO</a></h3>

<p>Syntax: tempo <i>beat, time;</i></p>

<p>The TEMPO statement defines the duration for rhythm values. The <i>beat </i>argument
represents a fraction of a whole-note and should be an integer value. The <i>time
</i>argument indicates the beats per minute. The following example sets the
tempo to quarter note at 120bpm.</p>

<pre>tempo 4, 120;</pre>

<p>TEMPO is a global control statement and affects all subsequent notes. It can
appear outside a voice.</p>

<h3><a name="time">TIME</a></h3>

<p>Syntax: time <i>seconds</i>;</p>

<p>The TIME statement sets an explicit start time for the next note in the
current voice. TIME should be used sparingly since it bypasses the automatic
start time calculation for notes. It is most useful when the sound must be
synchronized to an external source, such as a video. However, the parameter to
time can be any valid expression, including rhythm values and the <i>curtime </i>built-in
variable. This provides automatic conversion of the time value based on the
tempo and/or current start time.</p>

<pre>
time 10;
time curtime+10;
time curtime+%1;
</pre>

<p>The first example sets the start time for the next note to 10 seconds,
absolutely. The second example moves the start time forward by 10 seconds. The
third example moves the start time forward by the duration of a whole note at
the current tempo.</p>
<p>TIME can also move the next note start time backwards. This is sometimes the
only convenient way to enter a complex polyphonic phrase. For example:</p>
<img src="images/score.jpg" alt="score" />
<p> can be transcribed as:</p>
<pre>
{C5, D5}, {%4, %4}, 100;
' Backup one half-note
time curtime - %2;
{R, G4, B4, R, C5, A4 }, {%8, %16, %16, %8, %16, %16}, 100;
</pre>

<h3><a name="track">TRACK</a></h3>
<p>Syntax: track <i>n</i>;</p>
<p>The TRACK statement changes the sequencer track for subsequent notes and resets the current time to zero.
By default notes are assigned to track zero. Track zero is started automatically when the sequencer is started.
When the track number is other than zero, all subsequent events in the voice are assigned to a separate sequencer track.
Tracks other than zero must be explicitly started with a START statement, but can be started, stopped and looped individually.
</p>

<h3><a name="transpose">TRANSPOSE</a></h3>

<p>Syntax: transpose <i>offset</i>;</p>

<p>The TRANSPOSE statement modifies the pitch of subsequent notes. The argument
to transpose indicates the number of semi-tones to be added to the pitch value
and can be negative or positive. Transposition is chromatic as there is
currently no concept of key signature in Notelist.</p>

<h3><a name="var">VAR</a></h3>

<p>Syntax: var <i>name</i>;</p>

<p>The VAR statement declares one or more variable names. Variables are used to
hold a value that can change during sequence generation. Variable names begin
with a letter followed by any number of letters and digits. All variables must
be declared before they can used. A single statement can define multiple
variables by separating the variable names with commas.</p>

<p>Note: Single letter variable names in the range [A-G], with or without a
number following, represent pitches and cannot be used as variable names.
Likewise, the single letter names W,H,Q,S,T represent rhythms.</p>

<pre>
var val1;
var oct, step;
</pre>

<h3><a name="version">VERSION</a></h3>

<p>Syntax: version <i>major.minor</i>;</p>

<p>The version statement sets the version number for the Notelist file. </p>

<pre>version 1.0;</pre>

<p>By default, the version number is set to the version of the Notelist
program. Subsequent versions of the program may alter the default behavior of
Notelist statements and it might be necessary to indicate that the prior
behavior should be used instead. By setting a version number as the first
statement in the file, the parser and generator will revert to the previous
behavior and the file will not have to be edited to be properly interpreted.</p>

<h3><a name="voice">VOICE</a></h3>

<p>Syntax: voice <i>number notelist</i></p>

<p>The VOICE statement indicates that the following statement applies to the
voice given by the <i>number </i>argument. The voice number can be any positive integer
value, and any number of voices can be defined.</p>

<p>See the example section above for more information on Notelist voices.</p>

<h3><a name="volume">VOLUME</a></h3>

<p>Syntax: volume <i>level</i>;</p>

<p>The VOLUME statement sets a value that is multiplied by the per-note volume
value. Using volume is similar to setting a mixer level on the synthesizer, but
is performed internally by Notelist. Setting the volume on a voice can help
balance the level between voices, but can also be used to generate a change in
volume level without having to explicitly set each note volume. This makes it
easy to produce a crescendo of notes that have varying volume levels, and to
vary the range of a crescendo later without having to reenter the volume levels
for all notes. For example,</p>

<pre>
voice 2
begin
  volume 30;
  {C3, G3, C3, G2}, {%16, %8, %16, %2}, {100, 80, 90, 100};
  volume 40;
  {C3, G3, C3, G2}, {%16, %8, %16, %2};
  volume 50;
  {C3, G3, C3, G2}, {%16, %8, %16, %2};
end
</pre>

<p>The keyword VOLUME can be abbreviated as VOL.</p>

<h3><a name="whiledo">WHILE...DO</a></h3>

<p>Syntax: while <i>condition </i>do <i>Notelist</i></p>

<p>The WHILE...DO statement is used to repeatedly execute a statement, similar to
a LOOP statement. Unlike a loop, the WHILE...DO statement contains a condition
to control the number of times the statement is executed. Whereas the loop statement
automatically increments the loop count, the expression that controls the while
loop must be explicitly calculated. The following example loops five times,
increasing the volume level by 20 on each step.</p>

<pre>
var val1;
voice 1
begin
  set val1 = 20;
  while val1 &lt;= 100 do
  begin
     C4, %8, val1;
     set val1 = val1 + 20;
  end
end
</pre>

<h3><a name="write">WRITE</a></h3>

<p>Syntax: write &ldquo;<i>string</i>&rdquo;;</p>

<p>The WRITE statement is used to display a message during Notelist file conversion.
It can be used for debugging or for informational purposes. 
The following statement displays the voice time at the point where the message is displayed.</p>
<pre>
write "Section 2 begins at " :: curtime;
</pre>
</body>
</html>
