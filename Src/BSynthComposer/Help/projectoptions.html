<h1>Project Options<hr/></h1>
<p>The Project Options form is used to set options for the synthesizer that apply to all projects. The values in this form are stored
in the registry and reloaded when <i>BasicSynth</i> starts.</p>

<p>
The <b>Composer</b> field sets the default composer name. The <b>Copyright</b> field sets the default copyright notice.
These values are used to initialize a new project.
</p>
<p>
The <b>Project Tree Options</b> buttons select optional features of <i>BasicSynth</i> that will appear in the project tree view.
</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Notelists</b> shows the notelist file entry in the tree.</li>
<li><b>Sequences</b> shows the sequencer file entry in the tree.</li>
<li><b>Script files</b> shows an entry for scipt files. Script files are short programs that are processed
by the synthesizer. (These are not yet implemented.)</li>
<li><b>Text files</b> shows the text file entry in the tree. Text files are used to asscociate generic 
text files with the project. These can be used to hold program notes, etc.</li>
<li><b>Libraries</b> shows the Library file entry in the tree. Libraries are collections of instruments.</li>
<li><b>SoundFonts</b> shows the Sound Bank file entry in the tree. Enable this if you want to use
sound bank instruments.</li>
<li><b>MIDI</b> shows the MIDI entry in the tree. This is used to set default program and volume
levels for MIDI channels. It is only needed if you have a MIDI keyboard.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The <b>Projects</b> field contains the default directory for project files.
</p>
<p>
The <b>Wave-In</b> field contains the default directory for WAV files used by the WFSynth insrument.
</p>
<p>
The <b>Forms</b> field contains the default directory for instrument form files. 
</p>
<p>
The <b>Colors</b> field contains the file containing color definitions for instrument forms.
</p>
<p>
The <b>Libraries</b> field contains the default directory for instrument library files.
</p>
<p>
The <b>MIDI In</b> field allows selection of the MIDI input device.
</p>
<p>
The <b>Wave Out</b> field allows selection of the wave output device (sound card).
</p>
<p>
The <b>Play Latency</b> field contains the value in seconds for playback latency. A longer latency time
creates a larger buffer for sound output. A larger buffer helps to prevent glitches in sound output,
but produces a longer delay between sound generation and sound output. A value of 1 to 0.1 seconds
is typical. However, when using a MIDI keyboard, this value should be set to the minimum amount (20 milliseconds) to avoid
audible delays between key press and sound output.
