the instrument type list. Press OK to close the form. The editor for a Tone instrument
is opened automatically.</p>

<p>
The Tone instrument is a pre-patched synthesis instrument consisting of a wavetable
oscillator, ADSR envelope generator, LFO vibrato effect and pitch bend effect. Tone
implements a simple form of additive synthesis. The waveform we created in Step
II is a blend of three partials and we can use that waveform for the oscillator
in the Tone instrument. Press the Select button in the editor to view the available
waveforms. Select the &quot;Wiggly&quot; item in the list and then press OK to close
the form.</p>
<p>
Set the envelope using the top row of knobs. Set the attack to 0.01, peak to 1.0,
decay 0.5, sustain 0.0 and release 0.1. Leave the other instrument settings at their
default values.</p>
<p>
To preview the instrument sound, click on the "On" lamp above the keyboard
at the bottom of the screen. This will activate the keyboard for immediate playback.
(Optionally, you can right-click the project item and select <b>Start the keyboard player</b>
from the popup menu.)
Make sure the Plink instrument is selected in the instrument list at the left of
the keyboard and then use the mouse to click on keys on the keyboard. If you don't
hear any sound, make sure your computer's sound level is up and that the speakers
are on. If the sound is distorted, try turning down the sound level. In general,
leave the computer's sound levels at a middle range when working in BasicSynth.</p>
<p>Close the Tone instrument editor.</p>
