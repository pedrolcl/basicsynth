    <p>
        Several example project and associated score files are located in the <i>BasicSynth/Examples</i>
        folder. These can be examined to get a general idea of how the synthesizer can be used.</p>

                A simple 12-bar blues piece using a combination of sampled drum sounds and synthetic
                bass, electric piano and guitar. The bass and guitar show examples of using pitch-bend
                effects. Drum samples are from <a href="http://freesound.org">FreeSound.org</a>.

                An example of an "ambient" composition using numerous polyrhythmic loops. Instruments
                include a mixture of synthetic FM drone and percussion sounds combined with sampled
                drum sounds. Sampled drum sounds are from the Tam-tam drum set, part of the <a href="http://wiki.laptop.org/go/Sound_samples">
                    OLPC project.</a>

                <i>Pulse</i> incorporates a variety of FM synthesis instrument sounds with filtered
                noise sounds. A porition of the score is generated using a morse-code program and
                then included into the main score. Note how the score is divided into multiple files
                for convienience.
