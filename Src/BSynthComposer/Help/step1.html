<h2>Step I - Create the Project<hr/></h2>

<p>Select <b>File-&gt;New Project</b> from the main window menu.
A standard file browser is displayed. You can use any folder to store projects,
but it is a good idea to put each project in a separate folder. Create a new
folder for the project, select that folder, and then enter <b>Steps.bsprj</b> in
the file name box. Press OK to close the file browser. An empty project will be created. Because
this is a new project, the project properties form is automatically opened.</p>
<img alt="project" src="images/projectproperties.jpg" />
<p>Enter a name for the project (Steps). The name will appear at the top
of the project viewer window and on the title bar. 
You can also fill in the Author, Copyright, and Description
fields. These are optional. For now, leave the remaining entries at their
defaults. Press OK to close the form. You can open the project properties form at
any time by right-click on the project name and then select the Properties
entry on the pop-up menu. However, after the project has been created you
should not change the project file path. To rename the project file,
use the <b>File-&gt;Save Project As</b> entry on the main menu.</p>
<p>The main window now shows a tree view of the project items on the left and a 
piano keyboard at the bottom of the screen.</p>
    <img alt="mainframe" src="images/mainframe.jpg" />
<p> You can hide or show the toolbar, status bar,  tree view and keyboard using the <b>View</b> menu.</p>
<p>Each entry in the tree represents a different part of the project:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Synthesizer - synthesizer settings and wavetables.</li>
        <li>Output - output file.</li>
        <li>Mixer - multi-channel mixer with effects.</li>
        <li>Notelists - score files.</li>
        <li>Instruments - instrument configurations.</li>
        <li>Wavefiles - pre-recorded sounds used by the WFSynth instrument.</li>
        <li>Libraries - pre-defined instrument collections.</li>
    </ul>
<p>
Almost all functions in <em>BasicSynth Composer</em> are available as pop-up context menus on the
tree view items. To access the menu, right-click on a project item. Commonly used
functions are also duplicated on the toolbar below the main menu. 
Each project item has a properties form that allows you to enter name, optional description, and item
specific information. To access the properties for an item, right-click on the item and select <b>Properties</b>
from the pop-up menu. Alternatively, you can select an item and then click the properties page icon
on the toolbar.
</p>
<p>The bottom of the window contains a virtual keyboard to preview sounds and
also enter notes by clicking on the keys with the mouse.  For a full description of the
keyboard, see <a href="player.html">Keyboard/Player</a></p>
<p>
Editor windows are placed to the right of the project viewer.  
Score files are edited with a syntax-highlighted text editor. Instruments are edited with
a specialized editor that allows direct entry of the instrument parameters using
knobs, switches and buttons. Multiple editors can be opened at the same time. 
When a file or instrument is opened for editing a tab is added to the top of the edit frame.
Clicking on a tab with the mouse will rotate the editor to the front.
