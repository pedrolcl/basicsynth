<p>The large knob on the left sets the master volume. This value will vary
the overall output level of the combined input channels. Values greater than 1
provide gain, while values less than 1 attenuate the sound.</p>

Changes made in the mixer editor are applied immediately to the mixer. However, sound playback
can sometimes alter the internal mixer settings so that they do not match the editor settings.
The <b>Set</b> button can be used to reset the mixer to the editor settings.
The <b>Clear</b> button clears the mixer buffers.

The button at the top of each channel turns the input on or off. The <b>Vol.</b> knob
sets the relative volume and the <b>Pan</b> knob sets the left-to-right position (balance)
of the input. The <b>Fx 0</b>knob sets the amount of the input sent to the reverb unit. 
The Effects units (Fx) are shown to the right of the input channels.

The <b>Vol.</b> knob sets the attenuation on the effect and the <b>Pan</b> knob sets the balance
for the effect output.
