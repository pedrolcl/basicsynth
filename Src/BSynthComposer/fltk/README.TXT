This is a prototype port of BasicSynth Composer to the FLTK toolkit.
It is not complete, and not very well tested, but should give a 
general idea of what needs to be done to port BasicSynth to another
GUI platform.

To compile, you will need the FLTK v1.1.9 libraries (http://www.fltk.org/).

The VS project file is set up to look in BasicSynth/OpenSource/fltk for fltk stuff.
