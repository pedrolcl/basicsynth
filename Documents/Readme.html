<h1>BasicSynth Library</h1>

<p><em>BasicSynth</em> is a set of C++ libraries for sound generation and
sequencing. The source distribution contains the source code to the libraries,
example programs, summary documentation for the classes in each library, and a
reference manual for the <em>Notelist</em> score language. Complete
documentation is contained in the <em>BasicSynth</em> book. Excerpts from the
book can also be found on the <a href="http://basicsynth.com"><em>BasicSynth</em>
website</a>. The example programs follow the book chapters and should be
studied along with the book. Even if you don't have the book, you should be
able to glean sufficient information from the included reference documentation
and examples to use the library.</p>

<p>To build your own synthesis program with <em>BasicSynth</em> you need at a
minimum the Include files and the Common library (<em>Lib/Common.lib</em>). The Include
directory and the Common library provide the sound generation, wave file and
sequencer code. The header file <em>BasicSynth.h</em> includes all of the library.</p>

<p>If you want to use the <em>BasicSynth</em> instruments collection in your
program, you must also include the header file <em>Src/Instruments/Instruments.h</em> and link 
the <em>Lib/Instruments.lib</em> library.</p>

<p>To include the Notelist score processor, you must include the header file
<em>NLConvert.h</em> from the <em>Src/Notelist</em> directory and link the <em>Lib/Notelist.lib</em>
library.</p>

<p>Note: Libraries on Linux have the <em>.a</em> extension instead of <em>.lib</em></p>
<p>Reference documentation on the libraries is conatined in the <em>Documents</em> directory.</p>

<h3>Building on MS-Windows</h3>

<p>There are several solution files that can be built depending on what you
want to do. All solution files are for Visual Studio 2008 (i.e. version 9). If
you have a different version of the compiler, you will have to reproduce the
project and/or solution files.</p>

<p>To build just the libraries, use the solution files in <em>Src/Common</em>,
Src/Instruments, and Src/Notelist directories.</p>

<p>To build the Example programs, use the solution file in <em>Src/Examples</em>. This
builds all the example programs and libraries.</p>

<p>To build the utilities, use the solution file in <em>Src/Utilities</em>.</p>

<p>To build the stand-alone command line synthesizer, build the project in <em>Src/BSynth</em>.</p>

<p>Each project provides four targets:</p>

<ol>
<li>Release Win32 - 32-bit version without debug info.</li>
<li>Debug Win32 - 32-bit version with debugging.</li>
<li>Release x64 - 64-bit version without debug info.</li>
<li>Debug x64 - 64-bit version with debug info.</p>
</ol>

<p>Output of the 32-bit release version is in Bin and Lib.
 The 64-bit version produces output in Bin64 and Lib64</p>

<hr size=2 width="100%" align=center>

<h3>Building on Linux</h3>

<p>There is a master Makefile located in the Src directory. This will build all
of the system. There is also a Makefile in each directory that can be used if
you only want to build part of the system. The file <em>BasicSynth.cfg</em> in
the Src directory contains the settings for the compiler and linker. Edit this
file to point to the appropriate places. Usually you will only need to change
the location of BSDIR in case you put the source in a directory other than your
home directory. By default, BasicSynth is built with XML support using the
libxml2 library. You should install the libxml2-dev package first before
building BasicSynth. If you do not need to use the project/instrument file
loading code, there is a null implementation of the XmlWrapper class that can
be used instead. The file is Src/Common/XmlWrapN.cpp and should be compiled and
added to the Common library in place of XmlWrapU.cpp</p>

<p>Output is to the directories Bin and Lib under the BasicSynth install
directory. (Note the capitalization!)</p>

<p><em>Note:</em><em><span style='font-style:normal'>I</span></em> have noticed
a problem with the GNU make that causes make to halt when descending three
directory levels. Running make with the command line argument
--no-print-directory fixes this.</p>

<h2>Utility Programs</h2>

<div align=center style='text-align:center'>

<hr size=2 width="100%" align=center>

</div>

<h3>Waveform Explorer</h3>

<p>This program allows setting each of 16 partials to construct a complex
waveform using the inverse Fourier transform (sum of sine waves). The resulting
waveform can be saved to disk as a WAV file and as a graphic (EMF). Settings
can be copied to the clipboard.</p>

<h3>FM Explorer</h3>

<p>This program implements a three oscillator FM synthesizer. Each oscillator
is combined with an ADSR envelope generator. Several presets are available as
examples. The program can save the sound to a WAV file. The settings can also be
copied to the clipboard.</p>

<h3>Reverb Explorer</h3>

<p>This program implements a Schroeder reverb. The loop times and reverb time
can be set from the program to hear how they affect the sound. Sounds can be
internally generated or loaded from a WAV file. The processed sound can be
saved to disk.</p>

<h3>Flanger Explorer</h3>

<p>This program implements a Flanger/Chorus effect. The delay times, modulation
depth, and amplitudes can be set to hear how they affect the sound. Sounds can
be internally generated or loaded from a WAV file. The processed sound can be
saved to disk.</p>

<div align=center style='text-align:center'>

<h2>BSynth</h2>

<p>This program is a complete synthesizer that runs from a command line. It
takes one argument, the name of the project file to process.</p>

<p>BSynth <em>project.xml</em></p>

<p>The documentation on this program gives the specification for the project
file and other related files.</p>
