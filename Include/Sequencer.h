/// Active note sequencer event
//
/// Active events are used internally by the sequencer
/// to keep track of currently sounding notes. The event is
/// created when the note starts and continues until the
/// instrument indicates it is finished.
///
/// Changes for ver 1.2: 
/// The isOn member now represents the event state.
/// The spare member is now flags and holds event options.
/// The event state transitions: OFF -> ON -> REL -> OFF
/// A transtion from OFF to ON sends a START signal to the
/// instrument. A transition from ON to REL sends the STOP signal.
/// The TM flag indicates whether or not to count down the duration.
/// For live keyboard input and externally controlled sequences, 
/// the TM bit is clear and the count is not used.
/// The caller must enque a subsequent STOP event to move the active
/// event into the release cycle. For internally timed sequence events, 
/// the TM bit is set and the transition to REL happens automatically
/// when the count reaches zero.
/// Events are stored in multiple track objects with track 0
/// holding the main sequence. Track 0 is started by default
/// when Sequence() is called. Tracks 1-n can only be started
/// by events on track 0 or by immediate events.
