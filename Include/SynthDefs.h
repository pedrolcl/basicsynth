	/// an opaque mechanism for initializing unit generators. The caller can load 
	/// values from a file or other source and pass them to the generator unit without
	/// interpretation. Most generator units will supply additional initialization
	/// and access methods where each value is passed as an explicit argument.

	/// For example, an oscillator would calculate the phase increment based on the last set 
	/// frequency value, while an envelope generator would calculate the slope of the initial segment. 
	///
	/// The initPhs argument indicates the reset condition. The range varies based on the 
	/// type of object. For an oscillator, phase has a range of [0,2Ï€], while for an 
	/// envelope generator, the phase might indicate a time in seconds. A value of 0 
	/// indicates the object should reset to a condition prior to any samples being generated. 
	/// A value greater than 0 indicates a condition after some samples have been generated. 
	/// A value of -1 indicates the object should apply any changed parameter values, 
	/// but should not otherwise change the current phase. Not all generator units utilize the initPhs argument.

	/// Objects that modify the current sample (e.g., filters, delay lines) may store the value
	/// and return a filtered value. Objects that generate new samples (e.g., oscillators, envelope generators)
