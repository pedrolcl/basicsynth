/// Interactive sound playback.
///
/// This class manages immediate playback of sounds. It waits for
/// a start event, then allocates an instrument and adds the instrument
/// to the list of active sounds. The instrument remains active until
/// a corresponding stop event is received. When no instruments are
/// active, the Player will continue to call the instrument manager
/// which must output zeros to the DAC buffer.
///
/// To play a sound, allocate a sequencer event and call the AddEvent
/// method from another thread. Unlike the Sequencer, events are removed from
/// the event list as soon as they are discovered. For every start event, 
/// a matching stop event is required. The event id field of the SeqEvent 
/// object is used to match events. The caller should NOT free the event
/// object; it will be deleted by the Player after it is played.
///
/// Timing of sample output is under control of the instrument manager.
/// In a typical setup, the instrument manager sends samples to
/// a wave output buffer. The wave output buffer will synchronize
/// sample output to the sample rate by blocking on the sound card
/// driver output routine.
///
/// The player should be run as a separate thread. New events are appended
/// to the event list by one thread and removed by the playback thread. 
/// In short, this is a very simple message queue between threads. 
/// The critical section mutex is used to synchronize access to the
/// event list. Optionally, we could use a non-blocking pipe or message queue
/// in place of directly adding to the event object list.
///
/// @note
/// Beginning with version 1.2 the Sequencer class can do everything the
/// Player can do plus run sequences and is the prefered way of doing
/// this now. The Player is still useful for small, interactive synth programs, however.
