//
// We have two options:
// 1. Indirect - samples are put into a local buffer and then
//             copied to the direct sound buffer when the local
//             buffer is filled.
// 2. Direct - samples are written into the direct sound buffer.
//
// The direct method is slightly faster, but the indirect
// method is safer since it always has a valid buffer.
