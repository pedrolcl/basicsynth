/// @brief Output samples to the sound card using ALSA
/// @details WaveOutALSA provides immediate sound output
/// for Linux versions of BasicSynth. Typically this class
/// should be created on a background thread and passed
/// to the instrument manager as the sample output object.
/// Consequently, there is nothing very sophisticated here.
///
/// When the output buffer is full, we pass the samples
/// to the driver and assume the driver will block us when
/// we need to wait for prior output to complete. 
///
/// To use this class, create an instance and then call
/// Setup(...) to open and prepare the device using the
/// current synthParams sample rate. We always do two
/// output channels. The "leadtm" value indicates how
/// much output is generated before calling the driver
/// and thus represents the synthesizer's latency. Typical
/// lead times are in the range 200-500ms for sequencing
/// and 20-50ms when playing a keyboard or other interactive device.
/// The number of blocks (nb) indicates a multiplier
/// that determines the latency value to snd_pcm_open.
/// For example, leadtm=0.5 and nb=2 means we generate
/// 1/2 second output before calling the driver and the
/// driver will maintain a 1 second buffer.
